    <p class="lead">
        In this assignment, I observed and interviewed users of the Coca Cola drink
        dispenser placed in the Ratty.<br>
        Below, I will present the details and my findings of the assignment!

<div id="interface" class="container-fluid text-center p-5">
    <h2>Interface</h2>
    <img id="interface-img" class="mb-5" src="images/interface.png" alt="drink dispenser drawing">
    <h4><b>Cola Drink Dispenser</b></h4>
    <div class="d-inline-block text-start">
        <h4>Key Components</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                touch panel
                <ul>
                    <li><b>drink options:</b> allows the user to tap and select various flavors for each option</li>
                    <li><b>category filter buttons:</b> allows the user to filter via low/no calorie, caffeine free, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>exclusive flavors button:</b> displays and allows the user to select exclusive flavors not found elsewhere on the interface</li>
                    <li><b>QR code:</b> the user can scan to pour a drink contact-free</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>ice dispenser:</b> the user can dispense ice by pressing on the metal bar with a cup</li>
            <li><b>drink dispenser:</b> the user can dispense the selected drink by pressing on the metal part with a cup</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        This interface intends to solve the problem of having to get different
        kinds of drinks from different dispensers by combining all kinds (soda, 
        tea, lemonade, water, etc.) into one drink dispenser with a digital 
        selection panel.
        <br>
        To use the machine, a user must first press on the ice dispensing bar with their cup to obtain ice (if they want), 
        select a drink type/flavor on the digital screen, and press on the drink dispensing bar to pour their drink.

<div id="research" class="container-fluid bg-white text-center p-5">
    <h2>Research</h2>
    <div class="d-inline-block text-start">
        <h4>Observations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Many users seemed accustomed to the way the machine worked.</li>
            <li>No user was confused as to which dispenser was for ice vs drinks.</li>
            <li>Only 1 user paused looking at the various flavors once selecting the drink type</li>
            <li>All users went to press the ice dispenser before looking at the digital screen</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Questions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>What was the feature you first noticed?</li>
            <li>Did you already have a drink in mind coming in?</li>
            <li>If so, did the design/placement of the drink buttons change your mind at all?</li>
            <li>Was the flow clear? Was what to do next obvious?</li>
            <li>Was there anything surprising or unexpected about the interface?</li>
            <li>Did you notice the buttons on the bottom or the exclusive flavor options?</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h4>Responses</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 out of the 4 users interviewed answered that the first feature they noticed was the collection of many options and colors on the screen.</li>
            <li>Many already had a drink in mind, but only one changed their mind after looking at the options. The one user who changed their mind picked a drink from the center cluster of drinks.</li>
            <li>All users found the flow and the expected actions to take very clear and unconfusing. They are also accustomed users of the machine, so not much thinking is required.</li>
            <li>No surprising elements were not found while they were interacting with the interface, but were surprised to find the filters and the Exclusive Flavors button once looking at the interface closely.</li>
            <li>3 out of the 4 users never noticed the filters. Some users had dismissed the Exclusive Flavors button to be an advertisement, as it seemed like a non-button, static element similar to the QR code.</li>
        </ul>
