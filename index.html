    <p class="lead">
        The goal of this assignment was to understand, empathize with, and tell the story 
        of users of a particular interface. 
        <br>
        To achieve this, I observed and interviewed 
        users of the Coca Cola drink dispenser placed in the Ratty. 
        <br>
        Based on the findings, I generated two different personas to best represent the 
        users, and a storyboard to tell one of the personas' story.
        <br>
        Scroll down to read about more details and my findings of the assignment!

<div id="interface" class="container-fluid bg-white text-center p-5">
    <h2><b>Interface</b></h2>
    <hr class="mb-5">
    <img id="interface-img" class="mb-5" src="images/interface.png" alt="drink dispenser drawing">
    <h4><b>Coca Cola Drink Dispenser</b></h4>
    <div class="d-inline-block text-start mx-5 lead">
        <h4>Key Components</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>
                touch panel
                <ul>
                    <li><b>drink options:</b> allows the user to tap and select various flavors for each option</li>
                    <li><b>category filter buttons:</b> allows the user to filter via low/no calorie, caffeine free, etc.</li>
                    <li><b>exclusive flavors button:</b> displays and allows the user to select exclusive flavors not found elsewhere on the interface</li>
                    <li><b>QR code:</b> the user can scan to pour a drink contact-free</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><b>ice dispenser:</b> the user can dispense ice by pressing on the metal bar with a cup</li>
            <li><b>drink dispenser:</b> the user can dispense the selected drink by pressing on the metal part with a cup</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        This interface intends to solve the problem of having to get different
        kinds of drinks from different dispensers by combining all kinds (soda, 
        tea, lemonade, water, etc.) into one drink dispenser with a digital 
        selection panel.
        <br>
        To use the machine, a user must first press on the ice dispensing bar with their cup to obtain ice (if they want), 
        select a drink type/flavor on the digital screen, and press on the drink dispensing bar to pour their drink.

    <h2><b>Research</b></h2>
    <hr class="mb-5">
    <p class="lead">To first find out how users of the drink dispenser interact with the interface, I observed and interviewed four different users at the Ratty.</p>
    <br>
    <div class="d-inline-block text-start mx-5 lead">
        <h4>Observations</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Many users seemed accustomed to the way the machine worked.</li>
            <li>No user was confused as to which dispenser was for ice vs. drinks.</li>
            <li>Only 1 user paused looking at the various flavors once selecting the drink type.</li>
            <li>The users who changed their minds tended to pick a drink from the center cluster of drinks.</li>
            <li>All users went to press the ice dispenser before looking at the digital screen.</li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <h4>Questions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>What was the feature you first noticed?</li>
            <li>Did you already have a drink in mind coming in?</li>
            <li>If so, did the design/placement of the drink buttons change your mind at all?</li>
            <li>Was the flow clear? In other words, was what to do next obvious?</li>
            <li>Was there anything surprising or unexpected about the interface?</li>
            <li>Did you notice the buttons on the bottom or the exclusive flavor options?</li>
        </ol>
        <br>
        <h4>Responses</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>3 out of the 4 users interviewed answered that the first feature they noticed was the collection of many options and colors on the screen.</li>
            <li>Some already had a drink in mind, but others changed their mind after looking at the options. Those who changed their minds were not exactly sure whether their decisions were influenced by the placement/design of the drink options.</li>
            <li>All users found the flow and the expected actions to take very clear and unconfusing. They are also accustomed users of the machine, so not much thinking was required. However, some did point out frustrations with the slow reaction time of the interface and confusion with how the drinks were clustered together.</li>
            <li>No surprising elements were found while they were interacting with the interface, but later on, users were surprised to find the filters and the Exclusive Flavors button once looking at the interface closely.</li>
            <li>3 out of the 4 users never noticed the filters. Most users had also dismissed the Exclusive Flavors button to be an advertisement, as it seemed like a non-button, static element similar to the QR code.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Some of the key takeaways and findings of this assignment were...
            <ul>
                <li>The users of the drink dispenser are generally divided into two groups:
                    <ol>
                        <li>users who appreciate the various, colorful flavors offered, and are willing to explore different flavors</li>
                        <li>users who simply want to hydrate and are not willing to spend time exploring other options</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Although the first group of users may greatly benefit from the Exclusive Flavors page and the various filters offered, majority of users do not notice their existence.</li>
                <li>Many users are repeat users, and are by now accustomed to the flow of the interface. Regardless, all interviewed users found the interface to be intuitive.</li>
